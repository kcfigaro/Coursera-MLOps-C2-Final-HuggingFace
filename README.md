## Tasks

A. Modify Hello World

1.  Run the following Hugging Face and Gradio web application `helloApp` by using:
`python helloApp.py`.
2. Change this application to be a calculator that adds two numbers using the calculator function in my lib.
i.e. `from mylib.calculator import add`

* Reflection Question:  Why does a web framework like Gradio help build machine learning solutions faster?

B. Run the `summarizeApp.py` by using `python summarizeApp.py` and type in some of the text found in `text.txt`.

* Reflection Question:  How does the prediction change when you type more or less of the document?

C.  Run `load_model.py` to see a full example of how to customize summarization applications.

D. Build a command-line tool that is similar in functionality to the gradio app using the click framework.

* Reflection Question:  What applications could you quickly build with pre-trained models?
